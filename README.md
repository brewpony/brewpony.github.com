# BrewPony Tech

http://brewpony.github.com

This is the "tech" side of BrewPony, which contains the developer blog, API
documentation, and other stuff.

## Why?

We are trying to minimize our dependence on Wordpress. Duke dislikes Wordpress
and wants to interact with Github Pages for developer-oriented stuff, which is
what he will be concentrating.

Coffee Roaster spotlights and coffee-specific things will continue to be on the
main brewpony.com blog.
